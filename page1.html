        <h2>About Mardi Gras-</h2>
        <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations
            are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the
            start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
            permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the
            last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and
            surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).</p>

        <p>The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
            schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest,
            Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding
            large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand
            marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings),
            as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders
            traditionally toss throws into the crowds. </p>

        <p>The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads,
            doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the
            same parade schedule and route each year.While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on
            Bourbon Street, major parades originate in the
            Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver
            side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take
            place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi
            Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>

        <h2>The Mayor - LaToya Cantrell</h2>
        <img src="pics/mayor.jpg" alt="The Mayor LaToya Cantrell">
        <p>LaToya Cantrell (born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans,
            Louisiana, a post she has held since May 7, 2018. Cantrell, a Democrat, is the first woman to hold the post.
            Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.
            Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier
            University
            of Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology.[3] She attended an executive training program at the
            Harvard
            Kennedy School.</p>
        <p>
            In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City Council seat vacated when former District
            B representative Stacy Head won an election to an at-large position. After the November election, candidate
            Dana Kaplan and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff, which Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote.[13]
            Cantrell served out the balance of Head's term, and was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014.[14]
            As a council member, Cantrell focused on health, housing, and criminal-justice issues. She introduced a bill
            banning smoking at restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health effects of secondhand smoke on
            service industry workers.[15] The council unanimously passed the bill in 2015.</p>
        <p>
            Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
            history.[28] Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a
            strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction
            Council tasked with finding solutions to violent crime.[29] Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes
            collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city
            infrastructure, public transportation, public parks, and green spaces.[30] As part of that initiative, in
            October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid manufacturers and distributors.</p>
